# MouseTools

A Python wrapper for the Disney API. Data is pulled directly from Disney.

I created this project to help with another project found [here](https://github.com/scaratozzolo/WDWWaits). Some parts of the wrapper were created with that in mind.

Installation will take some time as the initial database is set up and created. There is a lot of data to load and parse so just be patient.

You can install using pip:
```bash
pip install MouseTools
```
