# MouseTools

An unofficial Walt Disney World API. Data is pulled directly from Disney.
Yeah you could look at the code and figure it out yourself, but here's a library incase you're lazy.

If you needs something specific from the API open a new issue with a "feature request" label

### TODO:

- [x] Authentication
- [x] Function to get park data
- [x] Gather links to more info
- [ ] Functions to handle data found from links (schedules, stations, etc.)
- [x] Park advisories (returns in json {id:advisory})
- [x] Wait times obviously (returns json {ride:id})
- [x] Park IDs/Names
- [x] Attraction IDs/Names
- [ ] Restaurant IDs/Names
- [ ] Return IDs somehow
- [ ] Attraction types
- [x] Today park hours
- [ ] Other park hours
- [ ] GPS Locations?
- [ ] Setting self variables to what they're related functions would return
- [x] Investigate destinations (web/json crawler currently running)
- [ ] Disneyland?
- [ ] Nice file for names and ids: attractions, entertainments, parks uploaded to github
